WARNING:  The below CloudFormation templates are for demo and proof-of-concept purposes only, and are not intended for production environments.  Amongst other deficiencies, they:
    - do not follow the rule of least privileged access, and will create IAM Roles with the 'AdministratorAccess' AWS Managed policy
    - will serve traffic from the Elasticsearch domain over unencrypted HTTP connections

1.  Launch the 'aws_ebs_vol_lost_cfn.yaml' CloudFormation template, ensuring at least 2 subnets are selected.
        - This template will build out the required StepFunctions State Machine and Lambda functions that would action a Personal Health Dashboard event.  It also creates a small Elasticsearch domain for visualisation.
2.  Launch the 'aws_ebs_vol_lost_importantapp-cfn.yaml' CloudFormation template.
        - This template will build out the mock application that will be impacted by an EBS service disruption
3.  Copy the 'VolumeId' output from the 'aws_ebs_vol_lost_importantapp-cfn.yaml' stack.
4.  Replace the 'vol-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' values in the 'phd-mock-event.json' with the VolumeId copied in step 3.
5.  If desired, change the value of the 'id' and ''time' keys in 'phd-mock-event.json' - this will provide more realistic visualisations.
6.  Navigate to StepFunctions, and enter the State Machine '*VolumeLost-*'
7.  Create a 'New Execution', pasting the contents of your modified 'phd-mock-event.json' (i.e. including new 'VolumeId', and updated 'id' and 'time')
8.  Once the StepFunction has completed, open the Kibana dashboard (the URL can be found in the Outputs of the 'aws_ebs_vol_lost_cfn.yaml' CloudFormation Stack)
9.  In Kibana, under 'Management > Index Patterns', create an index pattern 'phd-events' using 'PhdEventTime' as the 'Time Filter'.
10. Under 'Management > Saved Objects', import 'elasticsearch-objects.json', overwriting all objects, and using 'phd-events' as the new index pattern.
11. Navigate to 'Dashboard > PHD Events' to see the event(s).
12. Repeat steps 3 to 7 to create additional mock events.
